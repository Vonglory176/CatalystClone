# CatalystClone
Built with React/Vite and deployed using Netlify, this is a mock online store that I’ve been working on over the past couple months to serve as a flagship project of mine. Much was learned on the fly, and I've made massive leaps in my understanding of these projects since starting on it.

The store has many features, some of which include Account Management (Firebase Realtime Database), a fully functional checkout system (Stripe API), and proper state-management (React-Redux) for maintaining areas like login-status, cart-items and notification-display. For quick and efficient product search, visitors also have access to tools like pagination, filters and a search-bar to easily find what they’re looking for. This has all of course been built to be fully responsive, and the web-application will scale to display on screens ranging from desktop to mobile without any issues.
